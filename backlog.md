### **Plan of Action**

**Phase 1: Setup, Fixes, and Initial Enhancements**
*   **Step 1.1: Integrate Animation Libraries:** I will add the `AOS (Animate On Scroll)` and `Anime.js` libraries to the project. This will provide the foundation for all the new animations.
*   **Step 1.2: Fix "Nuestros Productos" Checkmarks:** I will correct the HTML in the product features list to remove the duplicate checkmarks, ensuring only a single, styled checkmark appears for each item as intended.
*   **Step 1.3: Redesign Hero Section Button:** I will restyle the primary "Solicitar Cr√©dito" button in the hero section. I'll use a vibrant, high-contrast color and add a subtle, engaging hover animation to make it stand out.

**Phase 2: Content and Major Section Overhauls**
*   **Step 2.1: Populate FAQ Section:** I will completely overhaul the FAQ section, replacing the placeholder content with the detailed questions and answers you provided for all three categories. I will ensure the tabbed layout is clean and the accordion-style questions function smoothly.
*   **Step 2.2: Modernize "Services Overview":** I will redesign the "100% Digital, Seguro y Confiable, Acceso Flexible" section to be more visually striking, using improved layouts and scroll-triggered animations to make it more engaging.
*   **Step 2.3: Create Infinite Logo Scroller for Partners:** I will transform the static "Nuestros Socios" logo grid into a dynamic, continuous, and seamless horizontal scroller, creating a modern and professional feel.

**Phase 3: Advanced & Global Animations**
*   **Step 3.1: Animate the "Proceso Sencillo" Flow:** This is the centerpiece animation. Using your reference image, I will create a custom SVG path that connects the five steps of the process. As you scroll, I will use `Anime.js` to animate the drawing of this path and trigger effects on each step, bringing the process to life.
*   **Step 3.2: Implement Global "Startup-Style" Animations:** I will strategically apply professional fade-in and slide-in animations to cards, text blocks, images, and other elements across the entire page. This will create the sophisticated, "appearing-as-you-scroll" experience you described.
*   **Step 3.3: Refine Testimonial Transitions:** I will enhance the testimonial section by adding smooth fade-in and fade-out transitions between quotes, creating a more polished effect.

**Phase 4: Final Review**
*   **Step 4.1: Code Review and Cleanup:** I will conduct a final review of all changes, ensuring the code is clean, efficient, and responsive across all devices.
*   **Step 4.2: Present Final Work:** I will deliver the fully updated page, provide a summary of the improvements, and reflect on the enhancements made.
